# Foundation 
# Acceleration and brake was controlled using depth (z co-ordinate of hands)
# Body Pose did not yield good results for Brake/Acceleration
# Switched to ROI method to act as pedals for Gas/Brake
# Made the pedals position adjustable. Click and drag them to place them anywhere in screen
# Adjusted steering sensitivity to increase exponentialy accoring to the angle made with hands
# Dynamic throttle response : response increase quick the longer you hold the pedals (Still needs work)
