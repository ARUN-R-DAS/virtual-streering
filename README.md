Virtual Steering Wheel Controller for games

This controller lets you steer, accelerate, and brake using gestures. The project is powered by MediaPipe hand tracking and virtual gamepad emulation (ViGEm). The controller turns your webcam into a fully functional driving input for games without any physical controllers. It was a fun project to work on and I might improve it in future since there is a lot of room for improvement especially in responsiveness.
